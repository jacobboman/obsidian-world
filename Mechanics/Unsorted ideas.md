- The story levels up
	- The cities levels up
		- The narrative levels up
- Classes archetypes from where ever, choose a certain archetype to be a  rogue maybe you need "backstabber", but anyone can take it, so you can be a wizard rogue.
	- these types could be near endless, and while some would be specialities (with prerequisites) many would be accessible and useful for anyone.
	- It's a risk that these end up catering too heavily toward some power fantasy, and that's something to be mindful of
- Narrative fights, or; since a fight is usually a pathway to a narratively interesting point in a story, the fight has a "crescendo" 
	- Can stats boil down to how easy it is to get "spotlights" (as a resource) to do things?
- Push yourself i.e. "stress"
	- Everything is a resource; playing aggressively and using all resources should be ok, and getting more resources should be possible but at a cost of i.e. risk.
- Failure conditions and what is it worth to sacrifice your character for? 
- Dice as a power - pretty/novel dice are better <3
- Places not as in places on a map, but rather a possible place, to plug into any other world, or to use as a placeholder or replacement for any other, in whatever world is currently being explored: use parts of [[The Halls of Saints]] in the middle of Waterdeep, or [[The Epicentrum]] suddenly appears in the Docks of Duskvol
