 Magic is just defined as incremental damage in chunks for example small, medium, large and XL
	- A small spell would do 1d4 dmg, medium 1d6 etc.
	- A small spell could also only be an area of effect of +0, medium +5, and XL +15 or something.
	- healing would follow the same rules?
	- More abstract things like "conjure a magical rope"; length? time? 
		- Is every spell actually just "Wish"?

The core idea is that all magic is pretty easily accessible, but getting a strong effect is difficult.
