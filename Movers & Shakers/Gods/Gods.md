When the humanoidity had its first transcendence, the gods left them to their own devices.

The Gods are definitely individuals, but in some ways devoid of feelings and agenda, at least on the short term that most of humanoidity perceive them. 
Their individual domains are perfectly neutral, but wielders of their domains usually are not; where one person might arcanely wish to influence some part of the split of [[breath and sea]], both parts are always, to some extent affected – there is a constant push and pull between the principal forces or "[[Impetus]]" of their domain to maintain something like an equilibrium.

For example:
An archmage in service of [[The Spiced Coin]], seeks to bring ruin to the efforts of a rivaling trade guild, not yet sworn to the principals *stinking coin*. To accomplish this he brings about fierce waves, wrecking havoc on their fleet. A side effect of this makes one of their crew feel the breath of life, granting them powers beyond their physical form, making them strong enough to pull the ships to safe harbor.

It need not be a direct correlation, however:
An evil cult performs a dark rite to spread a deep and dark winter to a region as revenge for perceived slights. In the duality of [[ice and thought]], a scholar of high intellect might be expanded a hundredfold, literally absorbing an entire library's worth of collected texts.

An actor can also influence multiple *impetus'* at once:
Create an enormous ball of fire over a town to heat it in the winter, touching both fire and sky, thus influencing the inverse impetus' [[of fire and rock]], as well as [[of sky and light]]. In other words, *something* must happen to rock, but also to light.

Masters of their trade can make the ripples less noticeable when it comes to using [[Impetus]]. A wizard can pull on specific threads so that the effects are dampened.
