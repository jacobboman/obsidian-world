## The Epicentrum
it's split over a set of shards, of which one is the epicenter. Here time has completely stopped. People have been devoted to this place for thousands of years, and people have lost their lives (as in their loved ones due to the passage of time outside its sphere of influence) during their worship, or during the construction of the temple that surrounds the very core of this "entity".

The zone has at times (and at the/that moment) been heavily besieged. One such attempt is still ongoing in the southeastern quadrant.

The current rulers of the area have been in their position for a long (100+?) years, and have been able to utilize the effects of the epicentrum. 

### The Very Core
It's a,lmost impossible to see it, and being that close to the core, is tantamount to suicide. 
Part of the difficulty is the extreme mass of bodies that have built up blocking the view, but somewhere beyond that point is *something*, and some occult prophecies predict that that something is alive, and might soon wake up from its slumber.

## The different shards

## Scribes of the Eternal Scroll
They want to be the total and complete record of all time. They are basically neutral, but their knowledge can doubtlessly be used for evil.
