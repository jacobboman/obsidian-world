working title, but something to start with at least :)

The basic idea is that every action has a reaction within a gods domain. A god's domain is a set of two impetus'. Impetii? 

[[of shade and green]] has the two impetuses: **Shade**, as well as **Green**. Impetus is both the direction, and the action of change itself when influencing one part of that god's whole. This holds true for all gods, except [[The Arcane Creator]], [[The Ones Beyond]] and [[The Last God]]?

Impetus is the driving force of [[Magic]], and being a scholar of magic requires one to be clever in how to balance ones efforts, to avoid any bad counter reaction etc.
